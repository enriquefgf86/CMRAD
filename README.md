This is a practical test that implements Vue 3 technologies with Vuex as a state management solution, along with the use of TypeScript for secure typing. It also utilizes the progressive framework Vuetify for application styling without extensively relying on SCSS usage.

Each page has a scoped configuration for styling. Cypress, an open-source end-to-end testing framework, was used to test the functionality of this exercise.

### How to proceed in the application
Once the application is open, enter any data in the input field and press enter. This process will reset the input while simultaneously displaying what the user has typed in a span. It is important to note that if the user writes a word that starts with the special character "#", that word will be displayed in blue color, resembling a hashtag.
