This is a practical test that implements Vue 3 technologies with Vuex as a state management solution, along with the use of TypeScript for secure typing. It also utilizes the progressive framework Vuetify for application styling without extensively relying on SCSS usage.

Each page has a scoped configuration for styling. Cypress, an open-source end-to-end testing framework, was used to test the functionality of this exercise.
